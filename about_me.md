Hello everyone!

I am Adwaith Gautham. I am a software engineer at Cisco Systems, Bangalore. I am part of the Cisco's MIG(Mass-Scale Infrastructure Group) security team. I did my BTech in Computer Science and Engineering from National Institute of Technology Karnataka, 2019-20 passed out.

In college, most of the work I did was related to offensive security - vulnerabilities, exploitation methods, reverse engineering. I am now more interested in the defense. Safe systems programming(yes, Rust :)), programming languages, formal methods, formal verification, security protocols. I like offense, but defense is harder and exciting.

(Re)searching for a silver bullet which can be used to design and develop bug free, verifiably correct and safe systems.

All the opinions expressed here is my own and does not represent my employer or anyone else.

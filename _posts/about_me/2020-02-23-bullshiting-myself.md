Hey guys!

I am in my final semester of my undergraduation and I have to tell it, this has been the best semester! Not because its the final semester, lots of enjoyment, trips, time-pass etc., but because I have learnt quite a few useful lessons in this semester, realized certain things which I will never forget. So, I want to talk about all this in detail.

## 1. Pre-college days

My Pre-university (11th and 12th Grade) was just about struggle, learning new concepts in Physics, Math, Chemistry, solving loads of crazy problems. I understood a lot of things including hard work, frustration, stress and reward to hard-work. I had become used to reading new concepts, solving problems and understanding it. There was loyalty in what I did. I was a 100% loyal to my work. Yes, I left it when I felt stressed, but never cheated myself. I was at peace even when I was frustrated. Really loved that part of me.

## 2. My college life starts

I joined one of the most prestigious technical institutions in India. Classes, hostel life started and obviously I wanted to become a 10 pointer. I think this was just one of those thoughts you have when you are a topper and enter a new stage - you still want to be at top. Nothing wrong in that, but I think I was not ready to give everything to achieve it - It was just a thought, which faded away slowly.On the other side was the thought that I have struggled for 2 years and let me chill, pass time and "rest" for some time. The latter happened, I got a fair CGPA and first year ended. A bunch of highlights of my first year.

* In my first semester, I never bunked a single class. Not because I wanted to attend them, but because I was afraid what the professors would do if I bunked classes. Then came my second semester. I finally gained some courage and bunked a class - it was a physics class. After that, I started bunking classes frequently - for no reason actually. So, welcome my new habit. 

* During my 11th and 12th grade, I never ever spoke bad about my teachers. They were all exceptional. Even if they made mistakes, forgot something during teaching, I never even felt like mocking them or talking ill about them. But college was different. Suddenly, I became some guy who is greater than the professors who taught me. I started talking ill about most of the professors who taught me. It was not only me, but it looked like everyone around me had a problem with their teaching - so, I felt I was right in bad-mouthing them. All my friends, everyone mocked them. I don't remember when I developed this, but welcome my habit number 2.

* Second habit reinforcing the first, I didn't go to class **because** teachers were bad. I found myself a really nice reason for not going to classes. Teachers are bad. They didn't teach well. This meant, I had to study on my own. That didn't happen either. I had become too easy going. Anyway, I'll study right before exams, why should I study now? Instead, I'll do something else.

* I attended almost all the workshops that was conducted for first years - learned a lot there. This felt good.

This was a pretty easy year. A few good things happened, but I had lost a really important part of me. I was not loyal to work anymore. I bunked lectures, didn't study, bad-mouthed teachers, didn't learn stuff properly - this is just the opposite of me during my 11th and 12th grade. I didn't realize this transition had happened.

In the summer, I joined one of the summer projects offered by one of the best technical clubs in my college. Learnt a lot during that time. That was the starting point of my exploration to Computer Science. There was no compulsion, nothing. Just learning out of interest. I actually put in efforts and learned something about Computer Networks, Operating Systems. Felt really good about it. So, I would say at this point, I got a small part of me back - I worked on what interested me. I didn't work on subjects, topics which didn't interest me. That sounds perfectly fine right? Work on what you love, don't care about others.

## 3. Bullshiting: The unique, fantastic phenomenon

Second year started, I entered my department. Everyone were toppers here, too much competition and it became really hard to cope up with pressure. That is when a the unique, fantastic phenomenon called **Bullshiting** started.

Courses felt really hard in my third semester - Theory of Computation, which was full of proofs, coming up with intuitive answers, completely theoritical concepts like Turing Machines, CFGs etc., Oh My God! I just hated this subject. Along with that, we had a course called Concrete Mathematics - this was the hardest of all. I barely passed this subject. 

Why didn't I do good in these subjects?

Hehe! Teachers were not good. That is why I bunked a lot of lectures. I didn't really like the subjects. That is why!

You might be thinking that I gave this answer to my parents, friends when they asked me this question. NO. **This is what I told myself when this question came up**. So, you can see what is happening here. I couldn't see it back then.

Why didn't I actually do good in these subjects?

Even when I didn't bunk classes, I had to sit and properly study to understanding something. Now, I bunked class and I didn't read properly on my own. I studied one or two days before tests, exams. Obviously the outcome is known and evident.

Along with this, because I used to study just before the exams, I felt it really hard. Obviously if you try to gulp 4 months of learning in a day or two, your mind will not cooperate with you. Frustration builds up. Call up parents, vent out the frustration on them. Keeping telling subjects are really hard, "they are not good subjects", I don't like it. Never really thought **why** I felt this way.

Mathematics was my favorite subject and absolutely loved it during my preuniversity days, even though I didn't perform so well. But now, things had just changed.

I was frustrated that I didn't do well in exams. Consoled myself I'll do better next time. They were just a few subjects which I didn't like. They were not good subjects.

What happened next semester? You guessed it. The exact same thing. Bullshited myself.

I started fearing these type of subjects. I didn't focus on these types of subjects, I just let them go. **I felt I was becoming dumb and couldn't take up math courses**. I avoided all math courses later.

All this was happening, frustration inside me was building up. I had developed anxiety by this time, couldn't talk, interact with people properly. Was in a really bad state. Spent time at home. Went to counselling. I felt better. Was ready to conquer the field the next semester.

But it was not so bad. I found interest in a few subjects in Computer Science which I started exploring. That fetched my an internship at a beautiful place, although my CGPA was bad. Because this happened, 2 things triggered in my mind.

1. Focus on interests, it'll take you a long way.
2. CGPA doesn't matter.

So, I started working my interests completely, sidelining my academics again. Doing this had 2 effects.

1. I really started enjoying Computer Security, OS, Networks, Systems Programming my primary interest areas. I spent a lot of time working on this, and felt good.
2. Sidelined other fields of Computer Science. I didn't bother to explore much outside.

So, I felt I covered depth, but not breadth.

Any subject related to my interest area, I was keen on learning it. Rest, didn't focus.

You can say, I had developed a circular wall around me, a wall with really high activation energy. Any new subject needed high activation energy for me to explore it. 

**I was too comfortable in my corfort zone**.

There are 2 scenarios.

1. I am totally open to learning new things, but just wanted to explore my interest areas.
2. I got comfortable in my interest area. So, I kinda stopped exploring new things.

Although outcome is the same(not exploring new things), the reason behind it is different and I think the reason matters.

I was confident only in my comfort zone. Anything other than this, anything else, anything new - I would ignore, avoid discussions about it, convincing myself I am not interested in them because they are not my interest areas. When will you know you are not interested in some field? Only when you explore it and you didn't like it. But blindly deciding that you don't like it is another name for Bullshiting. This happened.

A lot of good came out of focusing on my interests(got a job too), but at the same time I got too comfortable with it and sort of developed aversion against other subjects. I didn't want to explore any other field. I think thats bad.

All in all, it was not looking good. Mostly because I didn't feel good. Even though I got an internship, even though I got a job an year later. There was something bugging me, something which didn't let me sleep.

There were other issues too. I was sorting one after the other. Parents and seniors, profs close to me helped me a lot. I spoke to them often. 

But, I think Bullshiting was the main issue. Because it helps you cover up all your complexes, insecurities and make you feel everything is fine and alright, the way you need it to be, even though it obviously is not because you are unable to sleep at night properly, unable to spend you day with energy.

I wanted to project myself as "I am perfectly alright" person - who would want to talk about all this which probably will shoo away his friends?. I think when something is not right and you don't want your friends, parents etc., to know, you start putting in effort into projecting yourself as alright - this is shit tiring and it doesn't do any good.

Seventh semester, I got a job. I was slowly improving from one end - slowly understanding my insecurities, confronting them and beating them one after the other. I must say, I never got the courage to confront my bullshiting habit. I didn't realize I bullshited so much until I stopped it.

## 4. Any way out?

There is always a way out, just need to find it and implement that way. In my opinion, the latter is very important. More often than not, we know the solution, but for some reason don't want to implement it. It could be peer pressure, you are just lazy, it could be the easy-going attitude, only I would know.

At the end of my seventh semester, I realized I needed to attend classes and focus. For some reason, I still bunked - so stupid of me. That was the moment, I fooled myself, knowing I was fooling myself. Felt bad for that, but still didn't go to class. The semester ended, not feeling any better.

My mental health improved a lot over 6th and 7th semester, but something was still not fine. There was still the hesitation to learn new topics, new subjects, feared math - theory like subjects, feared talking to people about stuff I didn't know, unable to sleep properly. Worst part is, I projected that I didn't like theory-like subjects. Truth is I feared them, not disliked.

One of my friends(not so close), whom I actually feared to talk to because he was a crazy high performer. At the end of seventh semester, we were talking something and he put a challenge to me: That I should sit in the second bench and attend every class, listen properly.

This was just the opposite of what I had been so far. And why should I be studious now? in the final year. I didn't listen to him and finished seventh semester as ever before.

The winter was surprisingly liberating. I had gone for a trip for 11 days, but it was not the highlight. On December 27th 2019, I spoke to a close friend of mine and confided. My core felt so light after that. I don't know what happens when you share your problem with a friend. You may not solve it, but it will definitely make you light => you'll get the strength to solve it.

Back to college for my final semester. My friend reminds me of the challenge. I take it.

Fast forward, almost 2 months now - 24th February 2020, the semester has been a blast.

I attended every single class, with almost no force at all - even when there is scorching sun(when I usually bunked), even if its the only class of the day - bunking that would give me a holiday, I went to those classes. I paid attention in every class, made notes. If I didn't understand something in class, I came back to room and made sure I got it right. I asked my friends, classmates if I had doubts - didn't hesitate. This was great progress because I feared talking to people who know something I don't know. I felt so silly realizing it. Every day I attended a class, it fueled me. I was able to see the change. I have taken up a math course, which needs some practice - lots of proofs, crazy interesting problems. I didn't want to screw it up like Concrete Mathematics. What did I need to do? Attend every class, make sure I understand whats being done in the class, come back and solve problems - just like old times! And its been pretty good so far.

Machine Learning is something I had never explored - one of the reasons being fear. This semester, I have a course and its been too good. It had a lot of math in it, one more reason why I am liking it a lot.

What suddenly changed in my final semester?

My friend's challenge was probably the activation energy I needed to get started. I never had a reason to come to class. Now, the challenge. Once I started attending classes, I didn't need the challenge anymore.

Going to classes was just a starting point I think. I have never felt so open to new things. That fear of new things has vanished, I talk to people and I learn things from them. I was a very closed-to-myself person. I think I am better now.

## 5. Getting back that part of your core

I think I got that part of me back - the preuniversity days me back. I think thats why I have been able to sleep better, actually laugh at jokes, basically everything levelled up. I think that void is slowing vanishing.

Main point is, I am loyal to what I do again. I have 5 courses, I want to put whatever I can into them. Not only courses - whatever I take up, I want to give everything. I am really happy I got this part of me back.

Now, enough bragging :P

## 6. The Running Away Attitude

Till my pre-university days, any problem - be it math or life, I dealt with it head-on. I confronted it and solved it, either myself or with parents' help. Fight or Flight - always Fight.

In college, I "Fight" only for things that interest me, things I like, things I am comfortable with. Others - like talking about something new, something I am not comfortable with, where a lot of learning happens - "Flight". I just kept bullshitting myself, just ran away from the problem every single time there was one. This didn't do any good.

If you have always been a person who confronted things, but suddenly you run away from them, you'll definitely not feel good. 3 years of my life - just ran away from problems.

This attitude won't do any good because the only way to solve a problem is to confront it and not to bypass it.

## 7. Why did I come to college?

In the middle of all this, one more question popped up - why did I come to college? Why does anyone come to college?

I have various answers.

To Chill, to make memories, to enjoy life, to learn what life is.

Why did I actually come to college? To learn.

My parents pay tuition fees for me to attend classes, learn something from there. But all I did is either bunked or went to class and chit-chatted. This point hit me real hard.

There are certain unsaid rules which you start following when you come to college.

1. You need to chill when you are in college, because later it'll be work, work and work.
2. You are in college, you somehow have earned the eligibility to bunk.

among a few.

Instead, I think they are actually these.

1. You need to chill, only once you are done with your work, your responsibility.
2. You can bunk, only if you have read that subject / will definitely read it later.

I had conveniently used the first 2 because, as I said convenient.

I came to college to learn. Primarily from courses etc., . But I did learn a lot on my own, with help of seniors. But definitely classes and courses would have taught me more and in some cases better. So, attending a class is my duty. My parents have paid for it.

Thats clear now.

## 8. Another level of Bullshiting

When you are satisfying your inferiority complex, your insecurities, you'll do anything, you'll think of anything to satisfy it. I can give a lot of examples, but I'll stick to one.

**1.** Networks, Operating Systems are actually really close to my heart. I learned a lot about them on my own. Still I got 7/10 in both the subjects. Why?

My great reasons(or excuses):

a. OS was too theoritical, classes were boring(as if I attended them), course instructor didn't teach well at all.
b. Networks - project I did well, theory is boring. I didn't have the reason of a bad course instructor because he was best of the best.

Now, I think the following are the reasons.

a. I didn't attend classes, I didn't care to learn what was taught. I prepped in the last minute and mostly wrote exams with whatever I knew. Leave everything, it was my duty to do the course well. Ofcourse, I had forgotten my duty.
b. Networks - I think I was overconfident. Learned my lesson.

Do you see the problem here? I love these subjects(I genuinely do), but I performed average in both these subjects. How is this possible? One possibility:

a. Whatever I have explored, learnt on my own was not sufficient to perform well in exams.

=> Courses would have helped me learn the subject better. Reading the textbook would have actually helped. Knowing OS theory helps a lot(I knew it, but bullshiting). 

Performance in 2 of my favorite subjects took a hit because of my easy-going, bullshiting attitude. 

So, just attending the courses would have taught me more than what I had explored - I think this is the purpose of any course, and it would have perfectly served its purpose had I attended it.

## 9. The Blame Game

How were exams for me?

I didn't focus most of the time. When the exams came, I start reading before a day or two. Obviously, finishing 2 or 4 months of syllabus in 1-2 days is not possible. I get frustrated. Call my parents. Vent out on them - saying courses are shit, college is shit, course instructors are shit, everything, everyone **except me** is shit - Aah! the classic form of bullshiting.

Exams don't go well. Crib even more for that - that I got a low pointer.

Whats the root cause?

If I had done my duty every day(takes a maximum of 2 hours), all this could have been avoided. I didn't do it and I am blaming the world for it. But I was too busy to do my duty.

On a side note, why were exams designed? I think they were designed to test your understanding etc., in a subject. Exams work under the assumption that I have been studying everyday and one day - we'll test your understanding. It doesn't work if I read **for it** a day or two before. This defeats the purpose of exams. So, what I did doesn' work well with exams.

There might be exams which actually don't test your understanding, probably only theory. But if I do my duty, I should be able to handle that too.

## 10. Carrying on this ignorant, careless attitude

I don't care about college. Next, my job will be like my college. Can I carry the same attitude there? Till when would I do this? Where will all this take me? My friend asked me all this. Thats the point I knew I had screwed up.

## 11. Conclusion?

This is something I wanted to share with all of you. Something I saw in myself. Bullshiting, running away, blaming something/someone. That too, bullshiting yourself is probably the worst form of bullshiting. Your integrity with yourself is broken, which definitely won't feel good.

Just feels a lot better putting everything down here.

I cannot thank that friend of mine who challenged me to attend classes. That changed everything. Thanks again.

Thanks for reading :)

Hey y'all!

From past 2 years, a lot has happened. I feel I have not really been myself all that time. Was always under pressure, fear, not happy at all. Even now, I feel low sometimes, but I am doing a lot better now. In this article, I want to share with you what I was going through, how I came out of it. I am still not sure if I want to open up about this, I am still scared, but I'll just go for it.

It is going to be long, I just want to tell everything!

## 1. My childhood: The race begins

So, I'll start with describing my childhood, how it influenced me.

I remember my childhood clearly from the age of 4, when I was in Lower-Kindergarten. I really didn't like school, I used to stand in front of the school gate and start crying that I don't want to go to school. On one side, the teacher is pulling me in and on the other side I am holding on to my father's hands real tight.

All I remember is, I got first rank in my LKG lol. They gave me a huge-ass shield, falicitated me in front of everyone. Now, I feel it was such a stupid thing - comparing bunch of 4 year olds and giving them awards, for what ? learning A, B, C, D quicker than everyone else.

My UKG was no different. It was the same. I got first rank, got that shield, got falicitated. Difference was that I made friends and I remember some of their names even now.

First grade, nothing different. 

My parents changed my school, I joined a better school.

This was the time where it was slowly setting in my mind that I was a first-ranker and I need to keep it up. No one really told this to me, but this is what I felt. Why should I keep it up? For all the attention I was getting, make my parents, family happy. I was really young to think of all this, but I was definitely concious about maintaining the first rank. **I was in the race now**.

My father and my uncle were both really proud of me, for doing well. They got me Extra maths and science books to read. 

Second grade was better. I stood first, they even gave me free text-books for the next year. This was the age when you slowly understand what is happening around you. A lot of teachers liking you, showing that attention, praising you in front of your fellow classmates, it gets into your head you know! 

Third standard was even better. I stood first, they gave me free books and attention increased even more. I even became my class-teacher's pet student. Comparing everyone with my me, my handwriting, my punctuality and what not. Obviously, no one would be punctual when they are little. Something influences them to be punctual, disciplined and all. In my case, there were 2 reasons - that I was the "ideal" student and my parents were really disciplined.

Fourth grade was no different from from third. I just kept getting more attention. Now, I was being recognized by teachers of other sections. At that time, that was a big thing!

Then there was a small change. In Indian schools, you atleast read 2 languages - first langauge and second langauge. First langauge was always English in my school and second language was my mother tongue, Kannada. 

Suddenly, my parents wanted to change my second language to Sanskrit. I was not okay with it at all, so my dad lied to me that be might get transferred to Kolkata sometime later and taking Sanskrit would help. I took it. I didn't know he lied to me then.

Fifth grade was a bit hard for me. I watched this terrible movie and it really fucked with my mind. I couldn't go to school properly, I couldn't eat, even if I go to school, I would come back home by lunch break. It was horrible. My parents did literally everything. Worshipped God, we went to sacred places and did rituals. My parents did everything they could to make me feel comfortable, but no. That is when, someone suggested counseling to my parents. We went to the counseling place and they gave a 8 week program.

Week after week, I could feel I was getting better. No medication, nothing. Just talking to my counselor. I really felt normal after this.

I was a kid, but I was able to understand something was wrong, but now, it is alright. I was able to go to school properly, do everything properly. Everyone were relieved.

Fifth, sixth and seventh grade, I never stood first in class, in olympiad exams, anything. I was 3-4th every year and my parents were happy with it.

Then high school!

New classmates, new class teacher, everything new!

I started doing good in exams, actually excellent, teachers recognizing me, all the attention. I was this person who never went to play, who never really spoke to anyone except a few close friends, always doing something in the library. I loved Trigonometry at that time. I simply used to solve S.L Loney sitting in the library. I made 1-2 close friends.

## 2. Superiority Complex hits me: Being that ideal student

I think this is where everything started. 

I was identified as a first ranker, a person who can solve any math problem etc etc., Lot of attention, lot of expectations to live up to. At home, everyone were happy with my performance.

I remember feeling this. I was in the library, people asked me to come to play cricket or something, but I obviously didn't go. At that point, I think I was doing just to keep up the expectations and not because I really wanted to. Didn't realize that then. I felt it'll help in my "future", didn't play because of that.

As time passed, when I was doing something, say solving a trigonometric problem, I really couldn't tell why I was doing it. Did I solve it out of interest or because I wanted to be the first one to solve it? Even now, I don't know why. There were obviously times when I actually wanted to study. But point to note is, there were many times when I didn't want to, but I did for the sake of it. One thing I do know is, I got even more attention, even more expectations to live up to. 

I always got full marks in Mathematics exams, not even half a mark less throughout 3 years of high-school. Every single teacher saw me as that ideal student.

I passed my tenth grade with "flying colors". My admission for pre-university was already done, even before getting 10th grade results. It all looked so good from this end.

Pre-University was a big thing. Getting into an IIT was the aim. Strived so hard as if my whole life was at stake, that my life depended on it. The whole environment was built that way. That you will be a nothing if you don't make it. 

More than learning, it was "fear of failure", your friends going to good colleges but you sitting in some stupid college, future doesn't look good right.

I did good there also. 

There are 2 rounds of exams to get into IITs. First round was a qualifcation round and second is the actual round which will decide your fate. 

By the time I was done with my qualification round, I was done, burnt out as fuck. I just couldn't solve one more problem of Simple Harmonic Motion or Mechanics. 

My parents, though very supportive, become over-protective when it comes to these things. My whole future depends on this right? Cannot take risk. Write all the Entrance exams there exists on this damn earth. Wrote BITSAT, Karnataka-CET, COMEDK, also wrote VITSAT(or whatever that was), PESSAT. I didn't want to write all of these, but you know "fear of how the future would look like" - do you want a good future or not? Wrote every exam, did well in most of them.

By the time the second round of exam came, I was seriously done preparing. I was so done that I told my parents that I am not studying anymore. I think they understood and left me. But they kept hinting me that my future will be good, just put in "efforts" for 20 more days etc., I just told no. I cannot. And as you can guess, the second round was a disaster and I didn't give 2 shits.

That was probably the first time I didn't worry about what people think. Generally, that thought would always come to mind. But this time, I was so frustrated that I couldn't bare it anymore.

Did decent in the first round and got into the college I am in - National Institute of Technology Karnataka. Here, I got the "best branch" - the Computer Science branch. I personally didn't have any choices, so obviously I had to go with my father's choice which is the best choice available. I didn't even know the C programming language properly when I joined NITK.

So far, so good. I got into dream college, a college many die to go for.

If you are thinking I am bragging too much about myself, just continue reading, you'll know why I have told all this.

## 3. Issue begins: Am I an imposter?

In first year, fully excited. Wanted to get 10/10 in all subjects and be a 10 pointer, I always have been, remember.

First test happened, it didn't go well at all.

That is fine, just one test. 

I ended up getting a 8.95/10 first semester. That is not bad, but I was slowly losing that first position, that attention which people gave.
Second semester, I got a 8.74. 

My parents were not so happy. I (and they) wanted me to put more "efforts".

I entered the CSE department and guess what, it ripped me apart. 

So much competition, all subjects felt tough. Ended up getting a 6.97 in third semester. That was a huge dip.

This was the time when everything started to fall apart.

Parents were not happy, they started worrying about me. I was not happy. Was not the topper anymore, didn't get any of that attention.

I thought I'd "work hard" and fix everything. 

But, it didn't happen. 4th semester was the exact same thing academically, but mentally, it was worse than ever.

I had never experienced something of that sort. I am always fearful, I don't know what I am good at, everyone seems to be happy and going ahead in life, but me, I was failing in everything.

All the things that were present to identify me were not there with me anymore. I was no longer the best student, I was no longer the first ranker, I no longer got that attention, everything gone at once.

When you identify yourself with something and suddenly it is gone, what'll happen?

Self-doubt started. Once upon a time, I had everything - everyone liked me, I was the best student. But now, I have nothing. **Was I really good back then, or was it just luck?**. This question created a havoc in my life. 

How much every I study, no luck. All exams were bad. I kept asking that question to myself again and again. Whenever something came up, this was the first ever thought.

I don't know how, but I started believing that it was truth, that it was just luck which brought me till here. Now, this was like the secret about me, which only I knew. Obviously, why would I tell that it was all luck? I would lose literally everything and everyone I have. So, the sole goal from there was to secure that little secret of mine.

I have had so many sleepless nights. Many times, I would go cycling at 2, 2:30 in the night, feel tired and fall asleep - didn't really get sleep naturally. Have cried several times alone. I was in a position where I don't know what was actually happening, but I knew something was wrong. I couldn't tell anyone though.

My roommate, probably the best guy I have known so far, my best friend, I couldn't tell this to him. I was really scared that he would judge me and I would lose him. It was the same with everyone. I couldn't tell them with the fear that they'll come to know about my secret and they'll all leave me and go.

Back home, only my parents knew about my low GPA. No one else ever asked me all that. Whenever I met someone, they'd always say "NITK is the best college, you should be really good because you are in that college etc etc.,". But for me, I always felt irritated because I always felt I came in through luck, that I was not good enough. 

Even when I go back to school, all people still give the same attention and respect I got when I was in school. Just the difference is, I don't enjoy it anymore. I feel it was all just luck that I got it and not through anything else. Do you see the contrast? 

The outside world is the same, but the inner-self has changed drastically. It is reacting differently for the same input. Oh my mind!

My parents kept all the medals, prizes, sheilds I had won so far and had put it in a showcase. Whenever any guest/relative came home, they'd see that and start their "praising". I just hated that. It was really fucking with me. It was so irritating that I asked my parents to pack all those prizes and dump them in some room - asked them not to keep them in that showcase anymore. My parents didn't really understand why I wanted this - I didn't tell them either.

It just got worse day after day. The self-doubt increased so much, that I became so concious about even putting a message on the WhatsApp groups. What would they think, if I make a mistake, they'd come to know that it was all luck, that I was a fraud etc., 

My daily life was at stake now. Unable to talk to people, unable to message properly - just fear, nothing else. Suppose a question comes up and I don't know the answer, you can't believe how concious I would become about not knowing the answer. I'd overthink the situation. What if they ask me, I don't know. They'd come to know that I am a fraud. 

Now, my thinking was at stake. Whenever there is a question in front of me, instead of trying to solve it, the thinking goes in an entirely different direction. I'll keep thinking what'll "they" think if I don't get the question and that I am not good enough, that I am a fraud. 

Along with this, I was surrounded with so many people who were good at academics, coding or whatever they liked, that made me even more fearful.

I joined a really good technical club in the beginning of second year - it was actually the best tech club present in college. I was very much interested in Operating Systems, Reverse Engineering, CTF challenges etc., From first year, I kept doing something or the other related to this and I spent the whole summer learning more about this. Then I got into the club because of the same reason - I was apparently good at it. I don't know.

I found seniors with similar interests, interacted with them quite a bit, did some project, learn something out of it.

But, nothing made me feel better. I was probably stuck in that negative-spiral.

Problem is, I couldn't tell anyone. Everyone is happy and good. I was really scared to share what I was going through. Fearful that I was going through something ubnormal and fearful that they'd come to know that I was a fraud.

At the end of 4th semester, people are searching for internships for the coming summer, but I was totally uninterested. I just needed some peace of mind. Again, people are moving ahead, but I am doing nothing. My roommate asked me several times why I was not willing to apply for an internship. I always gave some other reasons - I want to chill, I want to read stuff on my own, I don't know enough to get an internship... I never once told him the truth. Sorry bro!

4th semester ended up as expected - bad. I was so tired and frustrated at the end of this, that I decided to to spend my summer at home, taking rest, getting better. People kept asking again and again why I didn't apply for an internship. I was not courageuous enough to tell the truth. I lied. I told I have some field in Computer Security which I want to explore, I need some time for that.

I spoke to one of my seniors, I told the same thing to him - lied to him also. 

My plan was to tell my parents about this, what I was going through and go to conseling. I remember getting better after going to counseling in 5th grade. So, I wanted to try that. 

I gathered all the courage I had, told my parents that there is a problem, that I am fearful, unhappy and told that I want to go that exact same person who counseled me years back. 

My parents, were supportive of it and I started going there. I was going conseling on a weekly basis. This helped like a charm. 

I started to feel better. I told whatever I was feeling, my school days, my past, everything I had in mind.

After a period of 10 weeks, I was feeling a lot better, although not perfect. 

I started preparing for Internship interviews. Got internship at a good place, which suited my interests. So, that was off my chest.

5th semester was going well, but I started to go back to what I was in 4th semester. All those fears, self-doubt slowly started to come back. It got really worse 2 months down the lane, I think I was feeling exactly the way I felt in 4th semester. I guess I was was too vulnerable to the environment, it really got me this time.

I had a breakdown one weekend. I just didn't come out of my room, kept crying for no reason. I even called my dad and screamed at him, yelled at him all sorts of things. Starting from him lying about him getting transferred to Kolkata, about not giving me choice of what subject to take in Engineering, the fact that I never really played with my friends during my school days, friends are enjoying - going to trips etc., but I am not, all I did was reading, studying for a better future. I was totally out that weekend.

Then I told him I am better and left it at that.

The only thing that was making me happy are CTF contests. I had a team - all seniors. In 5th semester, we played lots of CTFs, solving continuously overnight, solving new challenges, that rush was amazing. 

And at the same time, parents started asking my future plans - do I want to do MS or MBA or what? This question in particular made me furious as hell, because my present is not fixed, I am suffering from I don't know what illness, I don't feel good and now you want to know my plans about my future. I have shouted several times at them whenever they brought this topic. 

I told I don't know and asked them not to ask this question. They were worried about my future, but I am not sure if they were worried about my present.

It was in November, I was so fed up of feeling bad, self-doubts to next level, unable to think properly, no happyness, I wanted to be relieved of all this. I was finally ready to talk to someone.

That is when I started talking to one of my seniors(Let us call that person X). He was like the Superman who came to my life and sorted things out. I would like to share some of our conversations with you. 

At first, I was still not ready to tell about all this. So, I started by telling that I don't know what to do in future at all, that my parents ask what I want to do in future - MS or MBA. 

X slowly helped me in understanding the most important person I had to understand, **myself**. I had never really thought about this.

X started asking me fundamental questions like **What do I want?**, **What makes me happy?**, **What are your actual interests?**, understanding myself, understanding what I am, what I want. All along, I was doing mostly everything from the world's perspective. I did whatever I did to gain attention, trying hard to become what I was in school - in the process, I had totally forgotten about myself.

In the midst of all this, the only things that gave me happyness was playing CTFs, exploring my fields of interest, writing articles for my blog.

The questions X asked me, I had answer to **None**. X tried to explain the reality. 
```
X: You should focus on your happiness
X: If staying at home makes you feel happy, just stay at home!
Me: I think about such things, and then feel its stupid and chuck those thoughts
X: Why is it stupid?
X: Most people go to America make lot of money then realize it is not worth it.
X: These are very primal questions. Why do you exist? What gives you meaning?
X: Is it money, degree, appreciation from other or the virtual respect you get because you hoard these degrees?
X: Or is it just being happy with what you are doing?
X: It is OK to be a farmer also, as long as you are a happy farmer
X: Isn't that better than being a richer depressed programmer?
X: All these things are stuffed into our heads. Become famous, Become successful, Becom rich.
X: All bs!
X: Become happy, that is it
X: Just do whatever makes you happy, keep your parents happy
X: That is it
X: These are things and notions capitalist societies impose on us
X: Be productive, Be more productive, Be productive 24/7.
X: For what? For whom?
X: Most of it will not make sense. And you will see the mechanical nature in it
X: So you need to go back, unlearn all these things
X: And start focus on things that matter
X: Health, Family, Happiness
```
This was like a huge bomb on me, my thought process so far. My thought process was just the opposite. You have read so far, there is no single place that I did anything for my happiness. I may have become happy for an instant when I solved some problem first in the class, but I realized that is not happiness, This gave me some pleasure and motivation to do more, to do better but I realize that this was superiority complex which I had waiting to bite my ass later.

I really couldn't digest all this at once. Because I was taught to be the best, I was taught to be successful, I lived on that attention that I got for so long that I thought life is nothing without that. In college, no attention no nothing and I am suffering like this. There was this huge void inside me.

It had never hit me that I need to do something for my happiness. I never really asked that question to myself - **What makes me happy?**. All I did is to satisfy others expectations, make them feel good about myself, inturn feel good.

Questions started rushing throught my mind. Questions like 

1. What am I doing?
2. Why I am doing, whatever I am doing?
3. Do I really like it or am I just doing it for the sake of someone - to gain their attention etc.,?
4. Why should I become successful? Someone told my parents, told my teachers, told my friends to become successful. They told me, I also started running in the race to become "successful". I never really thought what "Success meant to me", "What my definition of success was". I took the generic societal definition of success - fame, money, influence and started running behind it. I didn't think if I needed it, if that is what I wanted to do in my life.
5. Endless list...

All this led to lot of self-introspection, started questioning every fucking thing, every thing I do.

For 16 years, I just did what the society wanted to do - run in the race. That is all mattered to them. Never once I thought "What I wanted, what I liked". I was good at Mathematics, good at science and that is why my parents, uncle brought me books to read more. I was good at scoring in school. I was good at all that. BUT, not sure I really liked it. Truth is I never really thought about it. They kept telling I could be better in the future, I kept doing it like a dumb-fuck. Being good at something doesn't mean you must do it. 

At this point, my actual therapy had began - I kept thinking about these things - the most fundamental questions of MY life, which were unanswered for 16 long years. 

I always have the thought of monetizing my blog and making a living out of it, but have always thought it is a stupid idea, because I need to have a good job, status etc etc., When I told this to X, the first question X asked me was "Why is it stupid?". If you like it, if it makes you happy, why not?

This way of thinking changed my entire thought process. "Everything in my life depends on me, my happiness, what I like, what I dislike, not anyone else, not the society no one". This was still hard to digest because no one ever asked what I wanted. My own parents never asked what I liked, what I wanted, why would anyone else ask. My parents' intention was obviously good - they identified that I was good at something and if kept doing it, I'd have a "bright future", but they never asked if I liked it or not. I was too small to understand how important that is. We are middle-class, fearful people, we fear what society thinks a lot. So, they did what the society asked - make me successful, get me into good college etc., Not their mistake too.

So, days passed by, still unable to focus on anything, still not in a good state, but I was constantly seeking answers to these questions. I found out, I was really lost. I literally didn't know what I wanted, what made me happy. It was refreshing to think about these questions, at the same time frustrating that I don't have answers to these and that I never really thought about these.
```
X: Most people live their life convincing themselves that they are happy what they are doing.
X: And then you get all kinds of stress and depression
X: That is the main problem
X: So you should sit down and get the basic facts clear in your head
X: Most of the time we burden people by imposing our idea of what we want them to be
X: Just because someone was borm with swimming skills doesn't mean you force him to be an Olympic medallist. That's left to him
X: You let him to do whatever the fuck he wants with his life. What makes him happy is none of my business
```
This made things very clear. That is what was happening with me. I was good at math and science, so they pushed me into doing something. 

I really started thinking about MY life, what I wanted, what I like, what I dislike etc., It was really hard to get any answer to this question.

Days passed by, winter passed. I am still feeling shitty, lot of self-doubt but now with a ray of hope - that if I understand myself, what I need, I'll get better.

A few days later in 6th semester, I again started feeling shitty. I was in no mood to do anything, crippled with self-doubt and what not.

I generally play CTFs regularly, it was almost a month since I played any. I really didn't feel like doing anything. 

X gave me this [amazing article](http://www.jkrishnamurti.org/content/chapter-1-education-and-significance-life) to read. X warned me that I may not be able to handle the content in this article. And X was true. I literally started crying in my room looking at how my life had become.

```
Me: I am always in this state where I feel I have lost something, I don't have something. 
Me: Looking at my cgpa(7.67), my parents are already worried if I'll struggle later in my career. They even told that I need to leave everything else and read properly. I stopped playing CTFs, one of those things I really liked to do.
Me: Always in a state of unhappiness.
X: You need to realize happiness is a choice.
X: My friend told me this and its very true
X: This moment. You can choose. If you want to feel happy or not. Its as simple as that
X: Coming to your CGPA
X: First, how did it go low?
Me: I have lost interest 
Me: I don't feel like reading for exams
X: Fair enough
X: Do you think you will struggle because of your CGPA?
Me: I don't know
Me: I have come to a state where I don't care
Me: I don't know if this is right or wrong
```

That is when he pointed me to a professor whom I can talk to about this issue. 

And slowly I got really comfortable talking to X and told about my childhood, how I was and why I think that is a problem.
```
X: There is something that breeds fear in you. What is it?
Me: Honest answer. I was a topper till 12th. Throughout 1st to 12th. Now, I am just some guy. I really feel bad that I think like this. But not able to get this shit out of my head.
Me: I don't know what I am worthy of. I feel something is going on in my life.
Me: Worst part is, I have figured out that I wanted to get full in Math not because I felt good, because I felt good because of all the attention I got. I think this mentality fucked me over.
Me: I think I know the problem, but I am not doing anything. I don't know what to do.
Me: You must be thinking how bad a human I am, but what to do. I was that guy. And I really, honestly want to come out.
```
There you go, I finally told my little secret to someone. I was so relieved at that moment, can't really explain.

Then X started explaining that all the fear I have because of insecurities inside me, that have bred in me over the years. I need to spend time with it, come face to face with my own insecurities and kill them.

So, I started thinking what are the things that I fear about? 

First and foremost, my little secret that I am a fraud, that whatever I got - everything was by luck. I didn't want anyone to know that. There was fear. There were other problems too - I constantly used to compare myself with others, feel inferior as fuck.

We spoke a lot over the next few days, X helped me get some insane clarity over my life. 

Things like, an action which we consider a mistake, is it actually a mistake? That is considered a mistake from societal angle. Suppose I got 2 job offers, one which offers me less pay but interesting work, other which offers high pay and work I am not really interested in. IF I choose the first offer, I am sure many people consider this as a mistake. That definition of "mistake" is a rule made by this sick as fuck society. It doesn't care what an individual wants. It didn't care what I want.

It is this environment - always talking about packages, pays, foreign countries etc., No one ever talks about stuff they are interested in, stuff they really want to pursue - very few and I think I survived because these few people. If we start talking about it, it is classified as "Deep philosophical shit", but I am sure they know that, that is the real thing, the thing that actually matters - just not courageous enough to admit it.

X made me think about really really fundamental things like this. I actually started feeling better, slowly understanding myself one bit at a time.

A few days passed by, I was in that wierd state where I was neither feeling good not feeling bad. I was actually feeling nothing for some time. 

And suddenly an event happened(which I can talk about, but people won't remain anonymous anymore), I felt all of a sudden, all my negative thoughts came back to me. I became as pathetic as I was before, probably worse. I started feeling worthless, Self-doubt came back, I got back the feeling that everything I did so far was through luck and that I am a fraud. It was terrible to feel like that.

Two days later, X asked me what was happening.

I literally told everything. That I could not focus on anything, that I feel everything is mechanical in nature, just doing stuff for the sake of it, not really enjoying it.

I told that I feel I have not done anything so far. I feel I got everything through luck and that bothers me.

```
Me: I feel I got into the technical clubs I am in through luck. I don't think I deserve to be there. I see so many people better than me, but didn't get into it even after they tried joining.
X: Don't fall into the trap of Imposter Syndrome. 
```

This is the first time I got to know there is a name for the thing I am suffering from.

```
X: Maybe you got lucky. Who knows? Maybe you got in cause you are damn good. Who knows?
Me: Exactly. I feel I got in through luck and that bothers me.
X: If you only focused on doing your work, what you like, you will not be bothered by shit like this.
X: We are all luckier than the kids born in the slum, will you give up your life for him? Will you feel bad everyday for existing? 
Me: Some other better deserving person lost chance
X: What makes  you think that if the other person got in and you didn't, they wouldn't feel the same way?
X: What are judging "better" based on?
Me: There are 2 things you can do. Sit and crib about everything - and I can assure you, you can do this your whole life because there is always something to crib about or wake up and do something - Your duty.
X: I don't know what you are bullshiting about not deserving and crap
X: I have told you so many times that there are a lot of people who hold you in high regard for the amoutn of dedication you put in working on some of the things.
X: I sent your blog to some senior I used to talk to. He was completely amazed. He said you will go places with a learning mentality as strong as that.
X: But you are sitting here and cribbing that some other stupid person who is "better" would have gotten into clubs if you hadn't.
X: So tell me, are you performing the duties you could be performing, or are you wasting your energy?
X: You could be playing ctf, you could be reading, you could be discussing some problem with someone
X: There is no deserve and better and crap like that man
X: I don't know why you have such a inferiority complex. This is all imposed on you by others.  As long as you are chained to the "scale" that others put on you, you will never be happy.
X: Stop thinking about all these things. 
X: Do your duty. There is nothing else to do.
```

This was probably the time I realized how comparing myself with others, trying to get others attention, craving for it made my life so miserable. 

## Being Happy

I am happy to tell you guys that I am better each day after this conversation with X. My internship went well, amazing work. Got a pre-placement offer. 7th semester so far has been a blast, organizing events, volunteer work, projects.

I have just been doing what I like to do. 

Slowly, everything is getting sorted. I am really happy at this point. 

I think at this point, I have some answers to the questions we were pondering upon before.

There are days when even now I feel low, but never have I gone into that negative spiral again.

Talking about how you are feeling to someone helped me a lot. I know it is very hard, but you need to. X was that person who helped me out. One of my professor helped me out a lot.

I have convinced my parents that I don't have any idea about my future, I have job at a really good company with me. So, I'll be working after college. I  hope they are fine with it.

There are some things which have helped me to come out of this.

1. After this, I found that someone praising me or someone's comments about me in general shouldn't affect me. I let other people's praises get into my head. Later when I didn't get that praise, I started to feel the void and all the problems started. That is when I realised than what "they" think is useless to me. Before, when someone praised me, I used to thank them a couple of times, talk to them in a nice way etc., But now, I find it stupid. If I have done a good job, I need to recognize it and be happy about it. I shouldn't be happy because someone told I did a good job, because someone else liked my job. I should feel I have done a good job, then I will automatically feel happy about it. Sometimes, when someone praises me for something, I seriously don't feel like thanking them, because it really doesn't matter!

2. I have done a bunch of things so far for which I am genuinely happy about. But I often felt I have not done anything or whatever I have done, it is all because of luck - which is not true. I cracked JEE-Mains exam with a decent score, this was not luck. I got an internship offer at Cisco Systems - this was not luck. Interview procedure was pretty heavy and they grilled for 3 rounds. But I felt all this happened because of luck. That is when I decided to do the following. Whenever I feel that whatever has happened, has happened because of luck, I write down every thing I put effort into. I put effort into building this blog. I put effort into learning about certain topic in-depth. I put effort into doing some of my projects. I put effort in conducting sessions for juniors. So, I am genuinely putting efforts, but don't feel like it. That is why, I re-ensure myself again and again that I put in genuine effort and all this is not by luck. I guess this has been a very important part of the healing process.

3. Never compare myself with others. This is probably the hardest thing to do, because the whole system is built with competition and comparision in mind. But, this has only ruined my life and happyness. 

4. Talking to someone about this - this feels like the hardest thing to do, but it is definitely the most important thing. I had to tell my "secret" to someone because it was eating me away.

## Sharing all this with you

When I got to know the terms "Imposter Syndrome", I started searching for articles, videos related to it. The following are some really good articles/videos which helped me out.

1. [It's Dangerous to Go Alone: Battling the Invisible Monsters in Tech](http://juliepagano.com/blog/2013/11/02/it-s-dangerous-to-go-alone-battling-the-invisible-monsters-in-tech/): This is the one I could relate to the most. A programmer speaks about Imposter syndrome, how it affects a person, how to fight it. Got to know that I could get over it!
2. [Do you have Imposter Syndrome ... too?](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ewv_47rhcQI): The Ex-CTO of HP talks about him fighting Imposter Syndrome. This is when I got to know sharing this secret of mine with everyone helps.

These are things which was eating me away for last 2 years. I started talking to X and my professor, I slowly started to come out of it.

There are 2 reasons for sharing this with you.

* That little secret of mine, that "I am what I am because of luck, that I am a fraud, I am an imposter" - I wanted to share it with you guys, so that it would not remain a secret anymore. That is one way to heal my way through this.

* Sharing this with you has been very wierd and hard. Even now, I don't know my friends and family would react to this, but the idea is to break that very stigma in the society and make people feel normal about mental illnesses. That way, people who are not feeling well would open up easily to people and recover.

One of my close friends asked me "not to give a hoot about others" when I told that I am scared to share all this with you. So, without giving a hoot, I have published it on my blog :P

## Final thoughts

I want to talk about a few things before ending this article.

# 1. System and me

I specifically want to talk about the Schooling system.

Starting from LKG till grade 10, everything is rank based. Students being evaluated solely based on their ranks is not doing any good. 

That too, grade-1 to grade-10 is where we grow, our mind, our personality grow in a certain manner. During this period, I think we are the most influentiable. When this is the case, students with better rank are treated better - it might seem good at that moment, but take my case, it bit me hard later. Don't even ask me about other students. There would be students who take it too seriously and they start feeling that they are worthless right in school, which is utter bullshit.

Things like praising the first-rank student in front of everyone, embarassing a student who failed a test in front of everyone - I have seen it all and all this is not doing any good to students. It is common for a teacher to think that students will become alright if they are punished, but I am not sure about it. I think just talking would also help. In that sense, my high-school class teacher treated all of us so well, she was just amazing. She was so supportive in everything, we could speak to her about anything without any hesitation. 

Once the student starts to make a picture about him/herself, what they are, it is very hard to change it later - This is what I feel. It took around 2.5 years to realize this and even now, there is constant effort from my side to become better. X told that you need to "unlearn" certain things you have learnt so far. I just realize that unlearning is so hard. 

Focus needs to be given on learning, on finding what you are interested in.

# 2. Thinking about the future

Oh I am really done with this. The talk about the future literally started when I was in 10th grade. Many might relate to this.

* Do your 10th grade examination well and your future is set.
* Do your 12th grade examination well and your life is set. 
* Do JEE / CET well and your life is set.
* Do your engineering well and your life is set.
* Do GRE well and your life will be set.
* Do MS / MBA and your life will set.

That is roughly 18 years of a person's life. There are a few things I hate about the above fucking thing.

1. This mentality will take away "the present" completely out of our lives. Whatever you do now, you are doing it to have a better future. So, you keep thinking about your future, dreaming about something and feeling happy or doing something you don't like thinking it'll all pay off in the end. 

2. And your life is never ever set. It is a lie which every parent, every teacher tells to a kid so that the kid would study now. This is the problem. If they want the kid to study, get him/her interested in the subject, don't lie.

3. This will make you totally unprepared for uncertainities of life. One question by JK which intrigued me is, how are you sure that your future will be set? That you will be alive tomorrow? A few days ago, one of my friends asked me if I will be the same guy writing code for some Networks or OS even when I am 30. I honestly don't know. Funny thing is, I know some people who have a 5-year plan, a 10-year plan.

Do you need to spend 18 years of your life(that too your precious childhood) thinking about an unknown future ? and every after that, future is always uncertain. It is a blatant lie!

I specifically elaborated on these 2 things because they influenced my life the most.

Anyway, I just wanted to vent out and I did. There are many things I want to talk about, but probably later.

I think that is it. I cannot tell you how light I am feeling at this point.

With that I'll end this article. 

Thank you for reading!

These are a few resources I have used to explore various fields in Computer Science. Hope it helps :)

1. [Reverse Engineering for Beginners(RE4B)](https://beginners.re/) : This book is the best if you want to get started with Reverse Engineering. Loads of examples related multiple Architectures like x86, ARM, mips, multiple Compilers - gcc, MSVC. 


The following is a small list of really amazing websites I have come across and have worked on a few things present in those websites. 

1. [challenges.re](https://challenges.re) - If you want to get started with Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation, this website is the best way to start!

2. [cryptopals.com](http://cryptopals.com) - Best Crypto site I have come across. Has programming exercises related to different cryptographic algorithms, different attacks on those algorithms. 

3. [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/) - If you are into Number Theory, Math, Programming, this is one of the best websites to go to!

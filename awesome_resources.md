These are a few resources I have used to explore various fields in Computer Science. Hope it helps :)

1. [Reverse Engineering for Beginners(RE4B)](https://beginners.re/) : This book is the best if you want to get started with Reverse Engineering. Loads of examples related multiple Architectures like x86, ARM, mips, multiple Compilers - gcc, MSVC. 


The following is a small list of really amazing websites I have come across and have worked on a few things present in those websites. 

1. [challenges.re](https://challenges.re) - If you want to get started with Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation, this website is the best way to start!

2. [cryptopals.com](http://cryptopals.com) - Best Crypto site I have come across. Has programming exercises related to different cryptographic algorithms, different attacks on those algorithms. 

3. [projecteuler.net](https://projecteuler.net/) - If you are into Number Theory, Math, Programming, this is one of the best websites to go to!

4. [crypto101.io](https://crypto101.io) - It is a introductory course on cryptography available in the form of a book. 

5. [https://yurichev.com/mirrors/DCC_decompilation_thesis.pdf](An amazing PhD thesis which talks about Reverse-Compilation/Decompilation Techniques) - I believe there are all the details needed to write a decompiler!

## Linux Systems Programming

I was searching for a few systems programming projects. I found these.

1. [Angrave's System Programming](https://github.com/angrave/SystemProgramming/wiki): This is probably the best resource to get started with Linux systems programming. Its just too good! 

2. [University of Georgia's Systems Programming Course](http://cobweb.cs.uga.edu/~rwr/CS1730/projs.html)

3. [University of Wisconsin-Madison's Operating Systems course](http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~dusseau/Classes/CS537-F07/projects.html)


## Computer Networks

### Network Programming

1. [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/) - One of the best guides for Network Programming in C. 


### Kernel Bypass Techniques

These articles (in this order) helped me understand Kernel Bypass techniques better

1. [Diving into Linux Networking  Stack](http://beyond-syntax.com/blog/2011/03/diving-into-linux-networking-i/) - A gentle introduction of how Network Driver interacts with NIC. 
2. [Inproving Linux Networking Performance](https://lwn.net/Articles/629155/) - This article clearly explains what are the problems with the current(2015) Linux Network Stack and a few suggestions to improve it's performance
3. [What is Kernel Bypass?](https://blog.cloudflare.com/kernel-bypass/) - An amazing article which will help you understand Kernel Bypass techniques which will help improve performance of packet IO. 
4. [netmap - A fast packet I/O Framework](http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/) - The official website of **netmap**. 
5. [netmap: a novel framework for fast packet I/O](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc12/atc12-final186.pdf) - netmap's official paper. Just amazing!
6. [DPDK - Data Plane Development Kit](https://www.dpdk.org/) - Official website of **DPDK**
7. [Impressive Packet Processing Performance Enables Greater Workload Consolidation](http://media15.connectedsocialmedia.com/intel/06/13251/Intel_DPDK_Packet_Processing_Workload_Consolidation.pdf) - Paper explaining DPDK
8. [Zero Copy Networking](https://old.lwn.net/Articles/726917/) - An interesting concept which helps in improving Network Stack performance
9. [Comparision of High Performance Packet IO Frameworks](https://www.net.in.tum.de/publications/papers/gallenmueller_ancs2015.pdf) - An amazing paper which will compare leading fast packet IO frameworks

## Computer Networks

These are a few articles which I found interesting

### Network Programming

1. [Beej's Guide to Network Programming](https://beej.us/guide/bgnet/) - One of the best guides for Network Programming in C. 



### Kernel Bypass Techniques

These articles (in this order) helped me understand Kernel Bypass techniques better

1. [Diving into Linux Networking  Stack](http://beyond-syntax.com/blog/2011/03/diving-into-linux-networking-i/) - A gentle introduction of how Network Driver interacts with NIC. 

2. [Inproving Linux Networking Performance](https://lwn.net/Articles/629155/) - This article clearly explains what are the problems with the current(2015) Linux Network Stack and a few suggestions to improve it's performance

3. [What is Kernel Bypass?](https://blog.cloudflare.com/kernel-bypass/) - An amazing article which will help you understand Kernel Bypass techniques which will help improve performance of packet IO. 

4. [netmap - A fast packet I/O Framework](http://info.iet.unipi.it/~luigi/netmap/) - The official website of **netmap**. 

5. [netmap: a novel framework for fast packet I/O](https://www.usenix.org/system/files/conference/atc12/atc12-final186.pdf) - netmap's official paper. Just amazing!

6. [DPDK - Data Plane Development Kit](https://www.dpdk.org/) - Official website of **DPDK**

7. [Impressive Packet Processing Performance Enables Greater Workload Consolidation](http://media15.connectedsocialmedia.com/intel/06/13251/Intel_DPDK_Packet_Processing_Workload_Consolidation.pdf) - Paper explaining DPDK

8. [Zero Copy Networking](https://old.lwn.net/Articles/726917/) - An interesting concept which helps in improving Network Stack performance

9. [Comparision of High Performance Packet IO Frameworks](https://www.net.in.tum.de/publications/papers/gallenmueller_ancs2015.pdf) - An amazing paper which will compare leading fast packet IO frameworks

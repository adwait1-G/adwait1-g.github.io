Hello Friend!

Welcome to pwnthebox!

This is the place where I write about the stuff I am exploring, stuff I am interested in.

# Experiments with Rust

I have been tinkering with Rust from past 6-7 months. I have documented some stuff [here](/rust/2020/10/11/rust-c-experiments.html).

# Operating Systems and Security

1. [Reverse Engineering and Binary Exploitation Series](/reverse/engineering/and/binary/exploitation/series/2019/03/25/reverse-engineering-and-binary-exploitation-series-mainpage.html): An introduction to OS Security, Assembly Programming, Binary Exploitation, Vulnerabilities and more!

2. [Breaking ASLR](/breaking/aslr/2019/10/30/breaking-aslr-mainpage.html): ASLR is a security technique which helps in mitigating code-reuse attacks, prevents jumping to buffers etc., It basically randomizes the addresses of a process. This is the documentation of my research on ASLR and on attempts to break it.

# Write your own XXXX

[Write your own XXXX: Home](/write/your/own/xxxx/2019/09/10/write-your-own-xxxx-mainpage.html)

One way to understand a concept or a topic is to read about it in great detail. For example, how does a debugger work? Linux provides a system call called ```ptrace``` which helps in tracing any process. The signal ```SIGSTOP``` is used to stop a process which is essentially a break-point, ```SIGCONT``` to continue.

You'll understand how a debugger works at a conceptual level, that signals are used to control the program execution, ```ptrace``` is used to get the trace process's inside information.

Do you want to know how exactly something works? Then write it! Code it up!

This is about the same. Writing your own **anything**. This is the place where I document them. As I write the tool, I'll write how the tool is written, piece by piece. You may use it like a tutorial, or another article about something you want to understand better.

# Computer Networks

1. [Packet Overflow!](/packet/overflow/2019/03/25/packet-overflow-mainpage.html): An introduction to Computer Networks, packets, wireshark, network programming!


# Blogging

1. [Setting up a Blog using Jekyll](/blogging/2019/03/25/setting-up-a-blog-using-jekyll-mainpage.html): A complete tutorial on setting up a blog using Jekyll


# Tools and frameworks

[Tools and Frameworks](/2019/09/19/tools-and-frameworks-mainpage.html): Writeups about some tools I have explored.


# Random Stuff

Here is the non-technical part of this blog. Random stuff, stuff I care about, I would like to rant about and more!
